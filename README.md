## Project Introduction

This project aims to help users understand current major news events and improve English learning skills by summarizing and presenting global hot news weekly. Each week we will release a news summary file with Chinese-English bilingual content, covering hot topics in economics, international affairs, technology, environment and other fields. By reading bilingual news content, users can improve their English proficiency and learn relevant professional terms and sentence patterns.
