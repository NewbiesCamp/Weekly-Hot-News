## Project Introduction

This project aims to use AI to summarize and display weekly global hot news, helping users understand current major news events while improving English learning skills. Every week we will publish a news summary file with Chinese-English comparison, covering hot events in fields such as economy, international affairs, technology, and environment. By reading the Chinese-English news content, users can improve their English proficiency and learn relevant professional terms and sentence patterns.
